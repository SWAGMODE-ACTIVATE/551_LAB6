# 551_LAB6

this htmlpage contains a leaflet map that users can draw polylines onto (this is powered by the leaflet.draw API!) once a line is drawn, it is added to the map and the two buttons at the top become enabled, one of which allows the users to delete the line and the other uses turf.js in order to simplify the line. Only 1 line can be on the map at a time, and drawing a new one will replace the old line. this is a very simple lab and most of the code is simply copy/pasted from the documentation examples of each respective API. the buttons at the top are disabled unless there is a line present on the map.
